    We believe horses should be horses—not unfeeling objects to use at our disposal, and that philosophy carries through to each of the creatures in our care. 


    That’s why we’re committed to using a natural horsemanship and animal husbandry approach to care for and train the horses and other animals here at Whistler’s Run, both personal and boarded. 


    What does that look like? 


    - Ample turnout time daily 

    - No pack-leader mentality 

    - Connection before correction 

    - Gentle care and training tactics


    While we understand that every boarder will have a slightly different approach to caring for and training their animals, any aggressive or potentially harmful treatment of horses or other animals at Whistler’s Run will _never_ be tolerated.

    Our top priority is ensuring the animals in our care are happy, comfortable and safe. You’ll never have to worry about your horse (or any of our animals) sitting alone, injured or stressed.

    ### Our care and safety measures:


    - Daily turnout with ample time and space to roam and graze

    - Hay and Tribute feed with top dressing given daily 

    - Multiple pastures and pens to pair animals of similar temperament and size

    - Blanketing, heated barn and rubber stall mats for Wisconsin winters

    - Close monitoring of physical and mental health 

    - Onsite emergency response care 

    - All the love and attention we can give!
