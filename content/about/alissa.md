Alissa founded Whistler’s Run along with her sister Lauren after working for 15 years as a psychology professor and family counselor. At the barn, Alissa focuses on growing a unique, personal relationship rooted in trust and consistency with each animal.

Alissa passionately advocates for the due rights of every soul at Whistler’s Run, including intellectual stimulation, physical exploration within a natural environment and having a “voice and choice” whenever possible in their daily existence.

Alissa also believes animals have quite a bit to teach people about the meaning of humanity and wakes up each day eager to learn more about what they are ready to share. Alissa looks forward to welcoming various populations to Whistler’s Run for educational and wellness experiences.
