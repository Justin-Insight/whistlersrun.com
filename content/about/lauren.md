Lauren purchased Whistler's Run in May of 2022 in a bold departure from her former career as CEO of CorLife, LLC, a prior business that she recently sold. She owns and operates the barn with her sister [Alissa](/about/alissa/), as well as her husband Nate and their four dogs.

Though working with horses wasn’t her focus for the first part of her career, Lauren has loved and had a passion for animals her entire life. She is an advocate of animal rescue and supports various animal rescues and other organizations throughout the U.S. in addition to caring for the rescue animals at the barn.

In founding Whistler’s Run, Lauren’s main goal has always been to provide the safest and most comfortable environment for the animals who call Whistler’s Run home. She has truly found her passion here at the barn and loves getting to know and learn from her boarders and barn visitors.

You can usually find Lauren spending time at the barn, passing out snacks and spending quality time with the horses, as well as simply enjoying the peace and tranquility Whistler’s Run has to offer.
